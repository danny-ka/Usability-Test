        <h1>Usability Study</h1>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>We studied the Carrefour Website. The target audience is the general public who need to buy products and goods. There are many carrefour stores all over the world so the target users are global.</p>
        <a href="https://www.carrefour.ke/mafken/en/">This is the link we tested.</a>
        <p>The representative tasks assigned were:</p>
        <ol type="A">
            <li>Buying or searching for products or goods.</li>
            <li>Comparing the prices and looking for discounts on said products.</li>
            <li>Seeing what you recently viewed and seeing what is in your cart.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <ol type="A">
            <li>We were able to search for goods to buy. We would have bought them </li>
            <li>We can compare prices especially because Carrefour shows offers in big font and great colors.</li>
            <li>The cart was easily accessible and I could see what I recently viewed.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Discussions</h2>
        <ol type="A">
            <li>What did we learn during this experience?
                <ul>
                    <li>We learnt that the websites need to be properly checked from a users Perspective.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Is the current design effective?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The current design is effective because it is very clear and easy to navigate. The design also gives you important information about important things such as discounts and deliveries.</li>
                </ul>

             <li>How might the design be more effective to help users easily perform the representative tasks?</li>   
            <li>The design could be better by not over-saturating the categories with too many products. </li>
            
        </ol>
